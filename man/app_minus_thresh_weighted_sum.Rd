\title{Weight feature importance sum on the basis of overfitting}
\usage{
app_minus_thresh_weighted_sum(k_cv_res, feature_importance_mat, k, penalty = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{k_cv_res}{result from run_cross_validation (called with condensed_output = TRUE)}

\item{feature_importance_mat}{feature importance values from each kTSCR iteration derived from how many times a feature was seen in a sibling}

\item{k}{k number of cross validation iterations, passed from run_cross_validation function}

\item{penalty}{a penalty used in the weighting. A (potential) hyperparameter. Default is 5.}
}
\value{
numeric vector of weighted feature importance sums
}
\description{
When calculating feature importance by tallying the number of times a feature is in a sibling within and then across k-cv iterations, weight the tally by the overfitting seen in the iteration, as measured by app_cor - test_cor

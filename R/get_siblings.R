#' Calculate weighted corr score
#'
#' Calculates a weighted correlation score that over weights higher correlations. When calling elders, this allows me to prioritize features that have are a part of a smaller number of highly correlative (with y) pairwise features as opposed to features that are a part of a larger number of relative less correlative pairwise features.
#'
#' @param corr a float between 0 and 1 representing the absolute value of a correlation coefficient (r)
#' @param max_score the maximum weight given to a correlation. Given that this weighted scoring can produce exponentially increasing weighted scores, setting this to 100 (representing a correlation of ~0.99) is reasonable.
#'
#' @return a float between 0 and 100, that represents a mapping of corr to a weighted score that overweights higher correlation values

#' Calculate weighted feature correlation score
#'
#' For every feature, this function calculates a feature correlation score that is dervied from the sum of all weighted correlations (see weighting function) between y and pairwise features that said feature is a component of.

Siblings are then the features that make up these pairwise features with elder.
